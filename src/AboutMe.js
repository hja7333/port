                Hey folks! ðŸŒŸ I'm a highly motivated professional with
                experience in education, software engineering, nationwide field
                sales, and international credit control. Picture this: I've
                danced my way through teaching, rocked it in field sales, and
                strutted my stuff in international credit control, all leading
                up to my epic graduation from the Northcoders Software
                Engineering Bootcamp.

                commitment to dropping innovative solutions. Now, I'm on the
